Simulated Data Generation:
The branch "simulated_data" contains files for generating simulated dataset for training NeRF models. The "multicamera.py" file is responsible for generating the dataset in the blender environment. Make sure to provide the absolute path of the multicamera.py file in the blender files.

Use the "cameras" list to select the type of camera, location of camera, intrinsic parameters, and number of data points to generate.
