This repo houses code and data for our work in Touch-GS.


## Quick Start and Setup


The pipeline has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.


### Requirements:

- CUDA 11+
- Python 3.8+

### Dependencies (from Nerfstudio)

Install PyTorch with CUDA (this repo has been tested with CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 11.8) and [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn).
`cuda-toolkit` is required for building `tiny-cuda-nn`.

For CUDA 11.8:

```bash
pip install torch==2.1.2+cu118 torchvision==0.16.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda-toolkit
pip install ninja git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

See [Dependencies](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/blob/main/docs/quickstart/installation.md#dependencies)
in the Installation documentation for more.

**Repo Cloning**
To clone the repo, since we have submodules, run the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/armlabstanford/Touch-GS
```

## Installing the GPIS code

We have implemented our own GPIS (Gaussian Process Implicit Surface) from scratch [here](https://github.com/armlabstanford/GPIS)!

Please follow the steps to install the repo there.

## Install Our Version of Nerfstudio

You can find more detailed instructions in Nerfstudio's README.


```bash
# install nerfstudio
bash install_ns.sh
```

## Getting Touch-GS Data Setup and Training

We have made an end-to-end pipeline that will take care of setting up the data, training, and evaluating our method. Note that we will release the code for running the ablations (which includes the baselines) soon!

To prepare each scene:

0. Install Python packages

```sh
cd touch-gs-data
# install requirements in touch-gs-data
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

pip install -r requirements.txt
```


1. Real Bunny Scene (our method)

```sh
bash scripts/train_bunny_real.sh
```

2. Mirror Scene

```sh
bash scripts/train_mirror_data.sh
```

3. Prism Scene

```sh
bash scripts/train_block_data.sh
```

4. Bunny Blender Scene (in progress)
