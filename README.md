## Datasets 

The datasets consist of two components - one for collecting RGB and depth images, and another for gathering touch image information.

The folder named 'touchnerf_rgbdepth' houses the captured color images and depth images. The corresponding transformation for each image is found in the 'transforms_train.json' file. For additional camera parameters, please refer to the 'multicamera.py' file in the 'simulated_data' branch.

Here is the link to the dataset:
